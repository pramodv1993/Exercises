Threads-
1.Each thread is associated with a priority based on the which the thread schedular in the JVM executes the thread with a higher priority
2.JVM is not obliged to honor the thread when it hints the JVM that it should be considered
3.Thread States:
NEW - not started
RUNNING - being executed by the JVM
BLOCKED - is waiting to obtain the lock so that it can get in to the monitor and execute the piece of code that is shared across threads
WAITING - waiting to get notify by other threads
TIMED_WAITING - sleep,blocked for join completion
TERMINATED - end

JOIN : when the join() method is invoked for a thread, it other threads will start only after the the current thread is done with its execution
