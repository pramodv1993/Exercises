DP:
This technique involves solving a complex problem by dividing into smaller sub problems like divide and conquer.
The solutions to these subproblems are used to solve the final bigger problem.
This can be done in 2 ways:
1)Top-Down approach(Recursion)-where we try and find solutions to bigger problem
2)Bottom-up approach(where we start from the smallest solution , store the same and use it to solve bigger problem)
 In the second way, we try to build a tabular structure where we store the solutions to smaller sub-problems and use the same for future reference.
  ex: Fibonacci of numbers for bottom up approach
  f[0] = 0;f[1] = 1;
  void fibo(int n)
  {
  if(f[n] != -1)
    return f[n];
  else
  {
   for(int i = 0 ; i< n ; i++)
    {

    f[i] = f[i-1]+ f[i-2];
    }
  }
  }
