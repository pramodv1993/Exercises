JAVA 8
U CAN HAVE DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION FOR METHODS IN INTERFACE.
BUT THERE SHOULD BE ONLY 1 ABSTRACT METHOD FOR THE INTERFACE TO BE CONSIDERED BY LAMBDAS
use the annotation @FunctionInterface

LAMBDAS:
examples:
fn = ()->sout("Hello World");
fn2 = (int a) -> return a*2;
fn2 = (int a, int b) -> a+b;
myLamba = (int a)->{a*2;sout("2 statements");}

//interface should have only 1 method without implementation but many methods with default implementations (default scope)
interface myLambda
{
int foo(int a);
default int foo2(){//asd}
}


FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES
eg:
Thread thread = new Thread(()->System.out.println("Part of run method"));

@FunctionallInterface
interface  myLambda
{
void func1();
void func2();//error as there should be only 1 method without implementation
}
