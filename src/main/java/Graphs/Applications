Applications :
1)BFS :
 a)Peer to Peer networks (where the nodes in the networks share the resources without the need for a centralised node eg: BitTorrent), BFS is used to find
   the neighbouring nodes in the network.
 b)Web crawlers in search engine:start from source page and follow all the hyper links to index pages.
 c)social networking website :FACEBOOK!
 d)GPS systems : nearest cinema halls, nearest food stops etc
 e)GARBAGE COLLECTIONS : object instances that is used at multiple points
 f)to determine if there is a path between 2 vertices

2)DFS :
a)Detecting a cycle in a graph.(give example with visited concept).

b)Topological sort(For Directed Acyclic Graph) :Mainly used in Job scheduling-why?
Topological sort says : If in a graph , there contains  edge (x,y) and (x,z) , then,
in the ordering (result), the vertex 'x' must appear before 'y'/'z'.
How do we modify our DFS to accomplish this?-tempory stack usage

c)Strongly Connected Component

d)Find a path between 2 vertices
